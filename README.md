# Quadruped Robot

This repository contains files relevant to the design, analysis, and testing of AARL's Quadruped Robot.

## Current Objectives
1. Update mechanical CAD to incorporate encoders.
2. Update electrical CAD to incorporate encoders and additional sensors.
3. Integrate Type Ia, Type Ib, and Type II sensory feedback.
4. Design legs with dynamical elements (springs & dampers).
5. Design legs with biarticulate muscles.
6. Design ANNs to perform bang-bang pressure control.
